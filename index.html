          As an old guy, I can never be certain what a particular emoji means,
          such as ‚òÉ or üçë or ü•ì. Some ARIA and CSS allows us to polish that üí©,
          letting sighted, clueless users like me to benefit. To experience it,
          put your mouse over any emoji here to see what it means. This does not
          help keyboard-only users unless I start dropping a tabindex on them,
          as I did with the keyboard and bacon above.

        <h2>About Emojiujitsu</h2>
        <p>
          We live in oculo-centric times or what is called a ‚Äúglance culture‚Äù as
          language becomes increasingly visual. Glance culture means we use much
          of visual media in the way we communicate without context, or
          reference. One example is when a blind user doesn't have a context of
          how emojis are used. This experiment is looking for other ways to
          provide equity in accessing emojis through other modals.
